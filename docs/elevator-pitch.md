# Quorum — Elevator Pitch

**Gathering potential.**

Quorum is a smart scheduling app that takes the pain out of organizing group gatherings. Instead of endless back-and-forth emails and polls, a host sets up a gathering with a few basics — what it's about, how long it needs to be, and where it could happen — and Quorum does the matching. It cross-references everyone's preferences with real-time location availability to find the best fit for people, times, and places all at once.

What makes Quorum different is the concept right in the name: you set a minimum number of attendees needed to make the gathering happen, and as soon as that threshold is met, the event locks in. No more waiting for 100% consensus — you just need your quorum. And if demand exceeds capacity, Quorum can automatically spin up additional sessions from the overflow, so no one gets left behind.

At its core, Quorum treats locations like participants. The system knows when and where spaces are available, and matches people, times, and places together — turning group scheduling from a chore into a one-step experience.

Whether you're organizing a one-off workshop, a recurring book club, or a multi-session community series, Quorum gets the right people in the right room at the right time — with the least effort possible.

Quorum is part of the Platopia platform — a collection of apps for organizing group experiences.

## Our Approach

Quorum addresses the full spectrum of group scheduling — from simple to complex — while keeping the experience frictionless for every user.

Whether you have an event that fills up quickly on any day, or you need to distribute 200 people from multiple timezones into 15 different limited series — hosted virtually, in-person, or hybrid — the experience feels the same: intuitive, fast, and effortless.

We achieve this through:

- **Minimum input** — Intuitive interfaces that collect only what's needed, then get out of the way. The host describes the gathering; Quorum handles the coordination.
- **Abstracted complexity** — Smart code and AI-enabled scheduling capabilities work behind the scenes. The harder the problem, the more Quorum does for you — but the interface never gets harder.
- **Scale without friction** — A dinner party and a 200-person conference series use the same workflow. Quorum adapts to complexity; the user doesn't have to.

## Differentiating Features

- **Quorum-based confirmation** — events lock in when the minimum threshold is met, not when everyone responds
- **Locations as participants** — three-dimensional matching across people × times × places
- **Availability sets** — hosts define multiple date/time combinations with different windows
- **Overflow gatherings** — excess demand automatically spawns new sessions from remaining slots
- **Invitee preference ranking** — top-3 ranking plus unavailability marking

## Where This Is Going

As Quorum matures, AI moves from behind the scenes to the front:

- **Agentic space discovery** — Quorum won't just match locations you provide. It will find available spaces on your behalf — querying public resources like library meeting rooms, checking real-time availability, and booking automatically. The host says "I need a room for 12 people" and Quorum handles the rest.
- **Intelligent scheduling** — AI that learns from patterns, anticipates conflicts, suggests optimal configurations, and proactively resolves scheduling bottlenecks before they happen.

The vision: scheduling a gathering for 200 people should feel as easy as scheduling one for 5.
