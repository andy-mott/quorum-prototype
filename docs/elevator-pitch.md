# Quorum — Elevator Pitch

Quorum is a smart scheduling app that takes the pain out of organizing group gatherings. Instead of endless back-and-forth emails and polls, a host sets up a gathering with a few basics — what it's about, how long it needs to be, and where it could happen — and Quorum does the matching. It cross-references everyone's preferences with real-time location availability to find the best fit for people, times, and places all at once.

What makes Quorum different is the concept right in the name: you set a minimum number of attendees needed to make the gathering happen, and as soon as that threshold is met, the event locks in. No more waiting for 100% consensus — you just need your quorum. And if demand exceeds capacity, Quorum can automatically spin up additional sessions from the overflow, so no one gets left behind.

At its core, Quorum treats locations like participants. The system knows when and where spaces are available, and as we grow, it will be able to tap into public resources like library meeting rooms and book them automatically through AI — turning scheduling from a chore into a one-click experience.

Whether you're organizing a one-off workshop, a recurring book club, or a multi-session community series, Quorum gets the right people in the right room at the right time — with the least effort possible.

Quorum is part of the Platopia platform — a collection of apps for organizing group experiences.

## Differentiating Features

- **Quorum-based confirmation** — events lock in when the minimum threshold is met, not when everyone responds
- **Locations as participants** — three-dimensional matching across people × times × places
- **Availability sets** — hosts define multiple date/time combinations with different windows
- **Overflow gatherings** — excess demand automatically spawns new sessions from remaining slots
- **Invitee preference ranking** — top-3 ranking plus unavailability marking
- **Future: agentic location booking** — AI that queries real-time availability and books rooms (e.g., public libraries)
